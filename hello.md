Hello, this is my attempt to follow the git workshop. I do not know what a markdown file is yet, but i'm sure i'll be taught what it is

apparently touch is like right clicking then make new file. I could technically just do it in the vscode explorer area but i'll try doing it this way for now.

we did a lot more damn
